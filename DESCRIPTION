Description: In discrimination experiments candidates are sent on the same test (e.g. job, house rental) and one examines whether they receive the same outcome. The number of non negative answers are first examined in details looking for outcome differences. Then various answering rates and their exacts confidence intervals are computed. Last, exact and asymptotic discrimination tests are performed. Graphical methods are also available.
